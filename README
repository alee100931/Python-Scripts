/* INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN CODE */
Download the Code:
On the GitHub repository page, click the green <> Code button.
Select Download ZIP.
Unzip the downloaded file to a local directory on your computer.
Install Python:
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can verify this by opening your command prompt or terminal and typing python --version (or python3 --version on some systems).
If you don't have it, download and install the latest version from the official Python website.
Install Dependencies (if any):
Navigate to the unzipped project directory in your terminal or command prompt (using the cd command).
Many projects include a requirements.txt file listing necessary libraries. If one exists, install them using the command: pip install -r requirements.txt
